/**
 * Branded `RefreshControl` wrapper.
 *
 * The platform default `RefreshControl` uses iOS system-gray on
 * iOS and Material grey on Android. Both look out of place in
 * LeadSmart's blue brand palette and particularly bad in dark
 * mode where the gray spinner gets lost against the slate-900
 * background. This wrapper threads the active theme's accent
 * color through both `tintColor` (iOS) and `colors`
 * (Android — the prop literally takes an array because Material
 * supports cycling through multiple colors during the spin).
 *
 * `progressBackgroundColor` (Android only) is set to
 * `theme.surface` so the puck behind the spinner blends with
 * the card surfaces in either mode instead of staying pure
 * white in dark mode.
 *
 * Props are forwarded — callers still pass `refreshing` and
 * `onRefresh` directly. Anything they pass for `tintColor` /
 * `colors` overrides the defaults.
