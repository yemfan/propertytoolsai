/**
 * Locale registry — single source of truth for every supported language.
 *
 * Adding a new language is a data change in THIS file only:
 *   1. Append an entry to `LOCALE_REGISTRY` with a BCP-47 id (`ja`, `es-MX`, …).
 *   2. Fill in `outboundToneDirective` (shapes how the AI writes to leads).
 *   3. Fill in `smsConsentCopy` (FCC requires consent in recipient's language).
 *   4. Run the template-seed migration with Chinese-equivalent variants
 *      for that locale (see `supabase/migrations/...localization...sql`).
 *
 * Everything downstream — prompt composition, template lookup, UI switcher,
 * translation service — reads from this registry. Business logic never
 * hardcodes locale ids.
 *
 * Scope split:
 *   - `outbound`  — the AI writes to a lead in this language.
 *   - `ui`        — the dashboard renders in this language (gated separately;
 *                   requires 100% message-catalog coverage before enabling,
 *                   per product constraint "user picks EN or ZH, no mix").
 *
 * A locale can be `outbound.enabled` long before `ui.enabled`. Chinese
 * ships outbound-on, UI-off in this PR, and ui flips to on when the
 * message catalog reaches 100% coverage.
