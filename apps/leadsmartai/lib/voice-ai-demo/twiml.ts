 * TwiML for the OUTBOUND voice-AI demo call. Structurally similar to the
 * inbound greeting flow in `lib/ai-call/twilio.ts`, but with a demo-specific
 * opening ("Hi, this is the LeadSmart AI assistant — calling because you
 * requested a demo") so the recipient understands the context.
 *
 * Once the prospect speaks, Twilio POSTs the SpeechResult to the
 * `gatherActionUrl` — which should be the existing inbound speech-handler
 * route. That reuse means the demo conversation runs through the same
 * processGatheredSpeech engine the production CRM uses, so what the
 * prospect hears is exactly what their leads would hear.
