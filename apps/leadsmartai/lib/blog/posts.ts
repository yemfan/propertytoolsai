/**
 * Blog post registry — drives the public /blog index and feeds
 * sitemap.ts. Each entry is a self-describing record so a new post
 * is one append-only change plus (optionally) a new route folder.
 *
 * Posts come in two flavors:
 *   - "article" — a hand-written narrative piece living at its own
 *     route (e.g. /blog/liondesk-shutdown-what-agents-should-do-next).
 *     We render a teaser card on the index and let the route file
 *     carry the full content + JSON-LD.
 *   - "evergreen" — an existing SEO content page (the cap-rate
 *     library) that already had a /blog/<slug> re-export folder.
 *     Listing them here keeps the index complete without forcing a
 *     content rewrite.
