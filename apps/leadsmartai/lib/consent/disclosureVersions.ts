 * v2.0 — 2026-05-25 — narrowed to marketing-only consent in response
 * to TCR A2P 10DLC campaign rejection citing "marketing consent was
 * combined with other consents." The v1.0 label bundled "customer
 * care and marketing" in a single checkbox; v2.0 limits the consent
 * scope to promotional messaging only. Transactional / account-update
 * notifications now require separate consent (out of scope for this
 * checkbox). Disclosure text:
 *   "Yes, send me marketing text messages from LeadSmart AI. By
 *    checking this box and providing my phone number above, I consent
 *    to receive promotional text messages from LeadSmart AI about
 *    real-estate services, new listings, market updates, and special
 *    offers.

 *    Reply STOP to opt out at any time, or HELP for help. Consent is
 *    not a condition of any purchase. See our Privacy Policy and
