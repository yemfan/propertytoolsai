/**
 * Sales Model System — central config.
 *
 * The whole feature is data-driven from this object. Adding a new model
 * means adding one entry here; every screen (onboarding, dashboard,
 * identity block, daily plan, tools grid, script generator, pipeline)
 * reads from `salesModels[id]` so the UI stays single-sourced.
 *
 * Why this lives in `lib/` (not `data/`):
 *   - Imported by both server pages (onboarding fetcher, validation)
 *     and client components (dashboard, dropdown). Keeping it framework-
 *     agnostic and free of `"server-only"` lets both sides share it.
 *
 * Validation rule: `SalesModelId` is the source of truth for legal
 * values. The Supabase `agent_profiles.sales_model` column gets a
 * matching CHECK constraint so a bad client write fails at the DB.
