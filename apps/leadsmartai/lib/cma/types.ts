/**
 * Pure types for the CMA (Comparative Market Analysis) feature.
 *
 * Mirrors the response shape of propertytoolsai's /api/smart-cma —
 * the upstream endpoint that owns the actual valuation engine + comp
 * pipeline. The leadsmartai CRM stores a snapshot of this response so
 * agents can retain, share, and re-show past CMAs without re-running
 * the engine.
 *
 * Don't add fields the upstream doesn't return — keep this file in
 * sync with propertytoolsai/app/api/smart-cma/route.ts. If the upstream
 * shape changes, version this file (CmaSnapshotV2) rather than migrating
 * stored JSON in-place; old reports stay readable in their original
 * shape.
