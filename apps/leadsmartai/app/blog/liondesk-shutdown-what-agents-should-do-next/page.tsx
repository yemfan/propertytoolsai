            LionDesk is shutting down. If you&apos;re still using it,
            you need a plan — now. A lot of agents are scrambling, and
            I get it. Pulling contacts, drip campaigns, and call notes
            out of a CRM you&apos;ve lived in for years is real work.
          </p>
          <p>
            But honestly? This is the best thing that could happen to
            your business if you use it as a forcing function to
            actually upgrade — not just lateral-move to whichever tool
            looks most familiar.

            <p>
              Most CRMs were built for teams, brokerages, and
              enterprise accounts. Solo agents get shoehorned into a
              tool that&apos;s overkill in some places — roles,
              permissions, lead-router rules nobody owns — and
              completely missing the one thing that actually moves
              deals.

            <p>
              That&apos;s the gap LionDesk never closed. Their pricing
              tier was right for solo agents, but the product was
              still a contact database with drips bolted on. In 2026
              that&apos;s not enough.

                LionDesk has announced a wind-down of its CRM product.
                Sunset timelines for tools like this typically run 60
                to 180 days, with read-only data export windows after
                that. Don&apos;t wait for the lights-out date — pull
                your contacts now while every feature still works.

              <p className="mt-1 text-sm leading-6 text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
                Look for AI text-back, missed-call recovery, and
                pricing that fits a solo P&amp;L. RealtorBoss was
                designed for exactly this segment — see how it

              </h3>
              <p className="mt-1 text-sm leading-6 text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
                Inside LionDesk, go to Settings → Data and export
                contacts and activity history as CSV. Modern CRMs
                accept a duplicate-aware CSV import with auto-mapped
                standard fields, so you can be live on the new
                platform the same afternoon.

                Will I lose my drip campaigns?
              </h3>
              <p className="mt-1 text-sm leading-6 text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
                Drip-campaign logic doesn&apos;t port cleanly between
                CRMs, but the underlying ideas do. Most modern
                platforms ship prebuilt sequences for buyer leads,
                seller leads, and re-engagement that are stronger than
                what most agents had hand-built in LionDesk. Treat
                this as a chance to upgrade the copy, not just port
                it.
