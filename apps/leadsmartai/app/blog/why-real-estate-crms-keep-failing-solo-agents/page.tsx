            What LionDesk&apos;s shutdown actually means

          <div className="mt-4 space-y-5 text-base leading-7 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-200">
            <p>
              LionDesk wasn&apos;t a fly-by-night vendor. It was the
              default CRM recommendation for solo agents for nearly a
              decade — affordable, simple enough to learn, and broad
              enough to cover the basics. When a product that
              well-positioned shuts down, it isn&apos;t a product
              failure. It&apos;s a market signal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The signal is this:{" "}
              <span className="font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white">
                a CRM that ships 2015 technology can&apos;t survive a
                market where 47% of leads go with the first agent who
                responds.
              </span>{" "}
              Drip campaigns and contact databases used to be the
              product. Now they&apos;re a feature checkbox inside a
              product whose real job is automated response, not
              storage.
            </p>
            <p>
              If LionDesk had ever shipped real AI follow-up,
              missed-call text-back, and a mobile workflow that
              didn&apos;t feel like an afterthought, this post
              wouldn&apos;t exist. Instead, every solo agent on the
              platform is now scrambling — and every other CRM in the
              category is using the moment to land-grab.
