 * [REQUIRES LEGAL REVIEW]
 *
 * Replaces the pre-launch placeholder flagged in TOM validation report CR-002.
 * Scaffold covers standard SaaS terms plus the specifics of an AI lead-
 * automation product: subscription billing via Stripe, 7- or 14-day trial,
 * SMS/email send-on-behalf, AI output ownership, acceptable use. None of it
 * is legal advice.
 *
 * Before accepting any paying customer, replace with counsel-reviewed copy
 * or a generator-produced ToS (Termly, Iubenda, TermsFeed).
 *
 * Sections still marked "[REQUIRES LEGAL REVIEW]" are gaps to close —
 * especially around liability caps, arbitration/dispute resolution, and
 * governing law, where defaults vary materially by jurisdiction.
