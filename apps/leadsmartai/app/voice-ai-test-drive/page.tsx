/**
 * Public marketing page for the Voice AI ISA. The thesis: don't try to claim
 * better voice AI in a feature comparison — let agents call the number and
 * decide for themselves. Composition order matters:
 *
 *   1. Hero (with the live phone number) — the experience-it part
 *   2. Sample transcripts — sets expectations before they call
 *   3. Comparison table — for evaluators who want a feature line-up
 *   4. Demo-request form — for agents who'd rather have it call them
 *
 * Server-rendered (with one client form island) so it's fast + SEO-friendly.
 * Hits the same Twilio + OpenAI Realtime engine the production CRM uses.

              No. The voice AI lives inside LeadSmart — your call recordings, transcripts,
