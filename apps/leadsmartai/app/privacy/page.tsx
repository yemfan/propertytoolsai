            <strong>Geolocation data</strong> — approximate location derived from IP. We
            do not collect precise device geolocation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Professional information</strong> — license number, brokerage
            affiliation, role.

          Agents may optionally connect their Google account to enable Gmail sync.
          When connected, LeadSmart requests the <code>gmail.readonly</code> OAuth

          conversations with CRM contacts. Connecting is explicit and reversible —
