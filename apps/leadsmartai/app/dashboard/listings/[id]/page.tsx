 * Listing detail page (Phase 2b of the listings/transactions split).

 * Note the URL: /dashboard/listings/[id] — distinct from
 * /dashboard/transactions/[id] which still serves post-acceptance
 * deals. A listing's back-linked transaction (if any) is reachable
 * from this page via the "Open contracted deal" link.
 *
 * Backwards compat: old /dashboard/transactions/[id] URLs that
 * happen to point at a listing-rep transaction still work — they
 * render the legacy TransactionDetailClient. Phase 3 deletes the
 * pure listing-rep transactions (the ones without an accepted
 * offer) so those URLs would 404 cleanly; until then both paths
 * coexist.
