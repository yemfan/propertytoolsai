/**
 * Public contact-form intake.
 *
 * Doubles as the proof-of-consent endpoint for Twilio toll-free
 * verification — the form at /contact is the user-visible surface.
 *
 * Order of work:
 *   1. Validate the submission (name + email required; smsConsent w/o
 *      phone is malformed).
 *   2. Persist a row in `inbound_contact_requests` (audit table from
 *      migration 20260510000000) with the IP, UA, and pinned disclosure
 *      version. Best-effort — a DB outage MUST NOT block the email send.
 *   3. Forward the submission via SMTP so a human sees it.
 *
 * The audit row is the load-bearing piece for TCPA defense — if a
 * carrier or regulator ever asks "show me proof this number consented
 * on date X", the row + the consent_disclosure_version is the answer.
