/**
 * Inline banner shown when an AI endpoint returns HTTP 402 — every AI
 * surface (SMS draft, script generator, deal review, growth
 * opportunities, deal assistant) renders this instead of an ad-hoc red
 * error so the failure mode + next step look the same everywhere.
 *
 * Two reasons → two copy variants:
 *   - `no_agent_entitlement`  → "AI isn't on your plan yet"
 *   - `ai_usage_limit_reached` → "You've hit this period's cap"
 *
 * Primary CTA fires the workspace upgrade modal via the global event
 * (so layout-mounted `EntitlementUpgradeModal` opens). Secondary link
 * goes straight to /dashboard/billing for the plan comparison.
