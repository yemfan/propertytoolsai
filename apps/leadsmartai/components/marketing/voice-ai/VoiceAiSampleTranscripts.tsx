/**
 * Three sample call transcripts that demonstrate the AI's range:
 *   1. Conventional after-hours buyer flow → tour booking
 *   2. SOI warm follow-up → equity story → consultation
 *   3. Objection handling → graceful human hand-off
 *
 * The third matters most. A common failure mode of voice ISAs is that they
 * dig in when challenged — that's the single biggest reason agents kill
 * pilots. Showing a clean hand-off here is the credibility move.
