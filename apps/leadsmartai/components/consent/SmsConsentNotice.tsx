/**
 * Renders the SMS TCPA consent disclosure text in one or more languages.
 *
 * Why bilingual:
 *   FCC rules (47 CFR § 64.1200) require TCPA "prior express written
 *   consent" to be in the recipient's language. When we capture leads
 *   from a mixed bilingual audience (mainland-Chinese-origin US buyers
 *   being the target segment for LeadSmart), we don't know the
 *   recipient's language at form-render time — so we display both EN
 *   and ZH stacked. The single checkbox still serves as the legally-
 *   operative consent action; the text in both languages is the
 *   disclosure record.
 *
 * Source of truth:
 *   The copy for each locale lives in `lib/locales/registry.ts` under
 *   `smsConsentCopy.text`, with a `version` field that bumps any time
 *   the text materially changes. The version string matters for the
 *   audit trail — `user_profiles.sms_consent_version` stores which
 *   version a given user saw, so if the disclosure is later revised,
 *   we can identify who's on an old version and re-consent if counsel
 *   requires.
 *
 * Extending to new languages:
 *   Pass `languages={["en", "zh", "es"]}` once the registry has a
 *   Spanish entry with `smsConsentCopy`. No code change here.
