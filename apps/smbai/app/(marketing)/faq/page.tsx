    questions: [
      {
        q: "What is HelmSmart?",
        a: "HelmSmart is an AI-powered front office for small businesses. It combines a voice receptionist, unified inbox, bookkeeping, and CRM into one platform — so you can focus on running your business, not managing tools.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I set up the voice receptionist?",
        a: "Connect your Twilio number or use Retell AI, then configure your business hours and appointment types in the Voice settings. The setup wizard walks you through each step in minutes.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need technical skills?",
        a: "No. Everything is configured through a simple dashboard. No coding, no complex integrations — just fill in your business details and you're live.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is there a free trial?",
        a: "Yes. You get 14 days free with full access to all features. No credit card required to start.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Voice Receptionist",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What happens when the AI can't answer a question?",
        a: "If the AI doesn't have enough information to help, it offers to take a message or schedule a callback. You'll be notified immediately so you can follow up.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can it book real appointments?",
        a: "Yes. The voice receptionist syncs with your Google Calendar and only offers time slots that are genuinely available. Bookings appear on your calendar in real time.",
      },
      {
        q: "What languages does it support?",
        a: "The voice agent operates in English by default. SMS and email communications include multilingual detection to match the language your clients use.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will callers know they're talking to AI?",
        a: "Yes. The agent identifies itself as an AI assistant for your business. We believe in transparent, honest AI interactions — and it builds trust with your clients.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Billing & Plans",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Can I change plans anytime?",
        a: "Yes. Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle so you never lose access mid-period.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the $0.10/min voice charge?",
        a: "Voice calls are billed at $0.10 per minute on top of your base plan. This covers both the AI processing and telephony costs. You only pay for calls that are actually handled.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is there a contract?",
        a: "No contracts, no commitments. HelmSmart is month-to-month and you can cancel anytime from your account settings.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Integrations",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Does it work with Google Calendar?",
        a: "Yes. HelmSmart connects via OAuth for a full two-way sync. The voice receptionist checks real-time availability and writes confirmed bookings directly to your calendar.",
      },
      {
        q: "What phone providers work?",
        a: "Twilio numbers work out of the box — you can bring an existing number or provision a new one. Retell AI powers the voice AI layer for natural, low-latency conversations.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I import my existing clients?",
        a: "Yes. CSV import is available in the Clients section. Map your columns to HelmSmart fields and your contacts are ready to use in minutes.",
      },
