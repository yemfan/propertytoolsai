        `Run at least two scenarios: a “base case” and a “stress case” with higher expenses or lower rent. If the stress case still meets your goals, you have margin. If not, revisit price, terms, or the property itself.`,

        `If you are investing, pair yield metrics with liquidity: how fast could you lease the unit at market rent? Check recent rentals near your target ZIP in ${loc.city} before trusting pro-forma rent.`,
        `For financing, confirm whether you are quoting APR vs. rate, and whether PMI applies. Small rate changes alter affordability more than many buyers expect.`,

If you are evaluating ${L} specifically, stress-test for local regulation (rent control where applicable), mello-roos-style assessments, and HOA budgets on condos and townhomes.`,

    },
    {
      question: `Does this replace an appraisal or loan approval?`,
      answer: `No. Outputs are estimates for planning. Lenders use their own underwriting; appraisers determine value for the transaction.`,

    {
      question: `How local is the math for ${L}?`,
      answer: `You enter the numbers that reflect your property and ${loc.city} market. The tool does not auto-pull private tax bills—use your best estimate or ask your agent for comps.`,

      question: `Can investors use this for rentals?`,

    {
      question: `What if interest rates change?`,
      answer: `Re-run the calculator. Small rate moves change buying power; modeling helps you set limits before you shop.`,
    },
    {
      question: `How do I share results?`,
      answer: `Use your browser share tools or copy inputs into a note. Some flows support shareable links where enabled.`,

      question: `Where can I get a full property report?`,
      answer: `Use the “Get a report” call-to-action to request a richer breakdown when available, or explore our home value and CMA tools.`,
