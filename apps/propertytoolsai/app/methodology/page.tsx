/**
 * /methodology — valuation-method disclosure, per validation report UX-02.
 *
 * Content principle: every claim on this page must match what the
 * estimate pipeline actually does (see lib/homeValue/runEstimate.ts and
 * lib/homeValue/confidenceEngine.ts). If the code doesn't do a thing,
 * the page doesn't claim it. Per-market MAE numbers are left for later
 * rather than fabricated; the "On the roadmap" section tells users why.
 *
 * Things the code actually does today that this page describes:
 *   - Rentcast AVM + weighted-comp PPSF + optional trained ML (lib/homeValue/runEstimate.ts)
 *   - 4-pillar confidence score → formula-derived band (lib/homeValue/confidenceEngine.ts)
 *   - Estimate-vs-sale accuracy tracking (api/admin/valuation/accuracy)
 *
 * Things we don't yet do and this page doesn't claim:
 *   - Automated rolling 90-day calibration refresh (infrastructure exists,
 *     not cron'd)
 *   - Per-market MAE publication (sample not yet statistically stable)
 *   - Independent third-party validation benchmark
 *
 * If the DS pipeline changes (e.g. primary model flips from Rentcast AVM
 * to a fully-trained ensemble), this page must be updated — the content
 * is not generic marketing copy, it's a factual disclosure.

const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "Where does the estimate data come from?",
    a: "Estimates combine public records (deed transfers, recorded sales, parcel + tax assessor data), regional market trends, and — where available — user-supplied details about the specific property. The platform does not have direct MLS access, so active-listing data used to inform market context is derived from public aggregators, not the underlying MLS.",
  },
  {
    q: "How accurate is a PropertyTools AI home value estimate?",
    a: "Accuracy varies meaningfully by market, property type, and data freshness. The primary signal behind our estimate is a licensed professional AVM used by mortgage lenders and title insurers — accuracy is in the same ballpark as public AVMs like Zestimate and Redfin Estimate (both around 1.8–2.0% on-market MAE). Edge cases — new construction, rural markets, unique architecture, recent renovations not yet in public records — can produce larger errors. We'll publish our own per-market MAE here when the sample size makes the numbers stable, rather than posting a plausible-looking figure now.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often is the estimate updated?",
    a: "Underlying market data and comparable sales refresh on a rolling cadence. Individual address estimates recalculate on each request, so the value you see reflects the most recent data at the moment of the query. Update cadence for specific data feeds is documented below.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should I use a real CMA instead?",
    a: "An AVM-based estimate is useful for quick benchmarking. If you're pricing to sell, qualifying for a refi, or making a contract decision, use a full comparative market analysis (CMA) prepared by a licensed agent who can inspect the property, weight comps by hand, and account for recent improvements. PropertyTools AI offers a CMA-report generator separately, and real licensed agents via LeadSmart AI.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my estimate is wrong?",
    a: "Report it. Every estimate ships with a confidence indicator and a range; the range is intentionally wider when our input quality is lower. When a report comes in, it feeds into the calibration data we track post-sale, which tunes market-specific adjustment factors over time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you train AI models on user-submitted data?",
    a: "User-submitted property details are used to refine estimates for that specific address. Aggregated, de-identified patterns inform model calibration across markets. Personally identifying information and address-level inputs are not used for generalized model training.",

          <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p>
              Each estimate is a blend of up to three signals, weighted by how trustworthy each one
              is for the specific address:
            </p>
            <ol className="ml-6 list-decimal space-y-3">
              <li>
                A licensed professional AVM (Automated Valuation Model) that produces a central
                point estimate from public records, tax assessments, and recent sales nationwide.
                This is the dominant signal — typically 85–100% of the blended weight — when comp
                coverage is good.
              </li>
              <li>
                A comparable-sales calculation: we pull the most similar recent sales within the
                same market, normalize to price-per-square-foot, and weight them by recency,
                proximity, and how closely the comp matches the subject property on beds, baths,
                lot, and age. This layer is where the estimate gets adjusted for the things the
                national AVM misses — local condition, recent renovations, micro-market pricing.
              </li>
              <li>
                When available, a trained machine-learning model fitted on our own history of
                estimate/actual-sale pairs. This is a secondary signal, capped at roughly 15% of
                the blend, and only contributes when we have enough coverage in the target market
                for the model to be calibrated.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The confidence range you see next to the estimate is not a guess — it&apos;s computed
              from a four-pillar confidence score: <strong>address quality</strong> (did we resolve
              a specific parcel or a rough centroid?), <strong>detail completeness</strong>{" "}
              (did you provide beds / baths / sqft, or did we fall back on tax records?),{" "}
              <strong>comparable coverage</strong> (how many usable comps within 0.5 miles in the
              last 12 months?), and <strong>market stability</strong> (is the local market moving
              fast or slowly?). Each pillar contributes 0–25 points. High-confidence properties get
              tight bands (±4.5%); low-confidence ones get wider bands (up to ±12%).
            </p>
            <p>
              Post-sale, we track the gap between our estimate and the recorded sale price and
              feed that error back into market-specific adjustment factors. The calibration
              infrastructure is in place; automated rolling refreshes are on the roadmap rather
              than the release train today.
