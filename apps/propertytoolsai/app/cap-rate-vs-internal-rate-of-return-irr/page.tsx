        Cap rate and internal rate of return (IRR) are both core metrics in real estate investing,
        but they answer very different questions. Cap rate is a snapshot of current income relative
        to price; IRR is a full-picture view of returns over time. Understanding how they work
        together helps you move from quick screening to deep investment analysis.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What is cap rate?</h2>
        <p>
          Cap rate compares a property&apos;s net operating income (NOI) to its value. It tells you
          the unlevered income yield you could expect in year one if you bought the property all
          cash at today&apos;s price.
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Purchase Price or Value
        </p>
        <p>
          Cap rate is most useful for quickly comparing properties and understanding how the market
          prices income in different locations and asset types.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What is internal rate of return (IRR)?</h2>
        <p>
          IRR is a more comprehensive metric that looks at the entire sequence of cash flows over
          the life of an investment. It is the discount rate that sets the net present value (NPV)
          of all cash in and cash out to zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practical terms, IRR answers the question: &quot;What annualized rate of return will I
          earn on my invested capital, considering all cash flows and the sale of the property at
          the end of the holding period?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          IRR calculations include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Initial investment (down payment, closing costs, upfront CapEx).</li>
          <li>Annual cash flow after debt service.</li>
          <li>Net sale proceeds at exit (sale price minus selling costs and remaining loan).</li>
        </ul>

          Cap rate vs IRR: snapshot vs full timeline
        </h2>
        <p>
          The biggest difference between cap rate and IRR is time. Cap rate looks at a single year
          of income relative to value. IRR looks at the entire investment timeline, including how
          long you hold the property and what happens when you sell.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Cap rate:</span> Year-one NOI ÷ price, no financing, no
            sale.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">IRR:</span> All cash flows (in and out) across years,
            including financing and exit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because IRR accounts for timing and growth, two properties with the same cap rate today
          can have very different IRRs depending on rent growth, value-add potential, and exit
          pricing.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Example: same cap rate, different IRRs
        </h2>
        <p>
          Imagine two properties, both purchased at a 6% cap rate with similar financing. Property A
          is in a stable market with flat rents. Property B is in an emerging area where you expect
          rent growth and value-add improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In year one, both properties show the same cap rate. But over a 10-year hold:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Property A&apos;s rents and NOI grow slowly; its sale price grows modestly.</li>
          <li>
            Property B&apos;s rents and NOI grow faster; you also invest in upgrades that justify
            higher rents and a higher exit price.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you run a full IRR analysis, Property B may show a much higher IRR even though the
          starting cap rates were identical. IRR captures that difference in growth and value
          creation; cap rate does not.

          Frequently asked questions about cap rate vs IRR
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Is a higher cap rate always better than a lower one if IRR is the same?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not necessarily. A higher cap rate often indicates more income today but may also signal
          higher risk or weaker growth. If two deals have similar IRRs, you may prefer the one with
          more stable income or lower risk, even if its cap rate is a bit lower.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Can a low cap rate deal produce a high IRR?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. A property purchased at a low cap rate in a strong growth market, or one with
          significant value-add potential, can deliver a high IRR over time due to rent growth,
          equity buildup, and a strong sale price at exit.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Do lenders care more about cap rate or IRR?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Lenders focus more on NOI, cap rate, and debt service coverage ratios because those
          determine the property&apos;s ability to support debt. IRR is more of an investor-facing
          metric for evaluating whether a deal meets your return targets.

        <p className="mb-3">
          Cap rate and IRR are not competitors—they complement each other. Cap rate helps you
          quickly assess income relative to price today, while IRR shows how a deal performs over
          its full life. Using both gives you a more complete, professional view of each investment.
