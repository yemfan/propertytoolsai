        Deciding whether to rent or buy is one of the biggest financial choices most
        people make. This guide shows you how to compare renting and owning side by

          1. Compare total out-of-pocket costs, not just payments
        </h2>
        <p>
          Many people compare their current rent to a potential mortgage payment and
          stop there. A better approach is to compare total out-of-pocket costs over
          your expected time horizon, including rent, down payment, closing costs,
          maintenance, and property taxes.

          2. Choose a realistic time horizon
        </h2>
        <p>
          Renting can be more flexible in the short term, while buying often becomes
          more attractive the longer you stay. Think honestly about how long you expect
          to live in the home—three years, seven years, ten years—and run separate
          scenarios for each.
        </p>
        <p>
          The longer you own, the more your upfront costs (like closing fees and moving
          expenses) are spread out, and the more time you have for potential
          appreciation and principal paydown.

          3. Factor in maintenance, taxes, and opportunity cost
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you own, you are responsible for maintenance, repairs, property taxes,
          and insurance. When you rent, your landlord covers most of these costs, but
          you do not build equity. You should also consider the opportunity cost of the
          cash tied up in your down payment versus what it might earn elsewhere.

          There is no one-size-fits-all answer. The right choice depends on your budget,
          job stability, lifestyle, and local market conditions. The key is to compare
          numbers side by side instead of relying on rules of thumb.
