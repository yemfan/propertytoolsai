        New and experienced investors often ask, &quot;What is a good cap rate for rental
        property?&quot; The honest answer is that it depends. A cap rate that looks great in one
        market may signal excessive risk in another. This guide breaks down how to think about cap
        rate ranges, risk, and return so you can choose targets that match your strategy.

          Cap rate basics: income relative to value
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cap rate, short for capitalization rate, compares a property&apos;s net operating income
          (NOI) to its value. The formula is:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Purchase Price or Market Value
        </p>
        <p>
          A 6% cap rate means the property produces NOI equal to 6% of its value each year, assuming
          an all-cash purchase. Investors use cap rate to compare income yields, but what counts as
          &quot;good&quot; depends on what you are trading off in terms of risk, stability, and
          growth.

          Typical cap rate ranges by risk profile
        </h2>
        <p>
          While every city and asset type is different, it is helpful to think in rough ranges when
          setting your expectations:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">3%–5% cap rate:</span> Common in prime, high-demand
            areas with strong tenant demand, limited supply, and perceived safety. Investors accept
            lower income in exchange for stability and appreciation potential.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">5%–8% cap rate:</span> Typical in many balanced markets.
            These properties can offer a healthy mix of income and growth, with moderate risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">8%+ cap rate:</span> Often found in tertiary markets,
            distressed properties, or neighborhoods with more volatility. Income looks attractive,
            but vacancies, collections, and long-term prospects may be less predictable.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Rather than chasing a single number, compare candidate deals to other properties in the
          same submarket and asset class. Tools like the{" "}

          Matching cap rate targets to your goals
        </h2>
        <p>
          A good cap rate for you depends on what you are optimizing for. A retiree looking for
          stable income may be happy with a lower cap rate in a blue-chip location, while a
          growth-oriented investor might pursue higher cap rates in emerging or value-add markets.

            <span className="font-semibold">Income-focused investors:</span> Often target higher cap

            <span className="font-semibold">Appreciation-focused investors:</span> May accept lower

          Why you should not chase cap rate alone
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is tempting to focus on the highest cap rate you can find, but cap rate is only part of
          the story. High cap rate properties can come with more intensive management, weaker
          tenant demand, or higher capital expenditure needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before committing to a deal solely because the cap rate looks attractive, use deeper
          tools—like the{" "}

          Frequently asked questions about good cap rates
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Is a 5% cap rate good for a rental property?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A 5% cap rate can be very good in a prime market with strong fundamentals and low risk,
          but it might be low in a weaker or more volatile area. Always compare 5% to typical cap
          rates for similar properties in the same neighborhood.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Should I walk away from low cap rate deals?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not necessarily. Low cap rate deals can still be attractive if they offer strong
          appreciation potential, the ability to raise rents, or strategic value in your portfolio.
          The key is ensuring the risk/reward trade-off makes sense for you.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          How do rising interest rates affect what is &quot;good&quot; for cap rate?
        </h3>
        <p>
          As interest rates rise, investors often demand higher cap rates to maintain a spread over
          borrowing costs. That can put downward pressure on prices. Monitoring both cap rates and
          financing terms helps you avoid overpaying in changing rate environments.
