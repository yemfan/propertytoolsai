 * [REQUIRES LEGAL REVIEW]
 *
 * Replaces the pre-launch placeholder flagged in TOM validation report CR-001
 * for PropertyToolsAI (the previous version literally contained the
 * dev-team instruction "refer to the complete policy your team maintains for
 * production" — visible to end users).
 *
 * Scaffold covers every topic a privacy policy for a real-estate calculator +
 * AI-valuation product must address. None of it is legal advice. Before paid
 * launch, replace with counsel-reviewed or generator-produced copy tailored
 * to:
 *   - Valuation data sources (public records, MLS where licensed,
 *     user-submitted property details)
 *   - AI processing (OpenAI / Anthropic) as sub-processors
 *   - Analytics + advertising cookies when wired
 *   - Stripe payment processing for Premium
 *   - CCPA/CPRA + GDPR user rights
 *
 * Sections still marked "[REQUIRES LEGAL REVIEW]" are gaps to close.
 *
 * Anchor ids for cookies (#cookies) and CCPA rights (#ccpa) are referenced
 * by the global footer ("Cookie Policy" + "Do Not Sell My Info" links) — keep
 * those stable, renaming breaks CCPA compliance link targets.
