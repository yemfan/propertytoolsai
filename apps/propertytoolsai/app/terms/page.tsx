/**
 * [REQUIRES LEGAL REVIEW]
 *
 * Replaces the pre-launch placeholder flagged in TOM validation report CR-002
 * for PropertyToolsAI. Scaffold covers standard SaaS + the specifics of an
 * AI valuation + real-estate calculator product:
 *   - Premium subscription billing ($19/mo) via Stripe
 *   - AI output ownership + disclaimers
 *   - Estimate accuracy disclaimer (AVM, not appraisal)
 *   - Acceptable use + scraping prohibition
 *
 * None of it is legal advice. Before paid launch, replace with counsel-
 * reviewed or generator-produced copy.
 *
 * Sections still marked "[REQUIRES LEGAL REVIEW]" are gaps — especially
 * liability caps, arbitration/venue, and governing law.

            an account, subject to fair-use daily limits we publish in the product.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Premium.</strong> Premium is a recurring monthly subscription
            (currently $19/month) that removes daily caps and unlocks full exports,
            unlimited CMA reports, and other features described on the pricing page. By
            subscribing to Premium you authorize us to charge your payment method on
            file through our payment processor (Stripe) on each billing cycle until
            cancellation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Free trial.</strong> Premium includes a free trial of up to 7 days
            unless otherwise stated. Unless you cancel during the trial, the paid
            subscription begins at the end of the trial. Trials are limited to one per
            customer; we may refuse trials we reasonably believe to be abusive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cancellation.</strong> You can cancel at any time from your account.
            Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period, and you
            retain access until then.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refunds.</strong> Except where required by law, subscription payments
            are non-refundable once the billing period has started.

            <strong>Price changes.</strong> We may change prices prospectively with at
            least 30 days&apos; notice.
