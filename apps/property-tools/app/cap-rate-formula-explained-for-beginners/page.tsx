        If you are new to real estate investing, cap rate can sound intimidating. The good news is
        that the cap rate formula is simple, and once you understand each piece, you can use it to
        screen deals in minutes. This beginner-friendly guide walks through the formula step by
        step, with clear examples.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">The basic cap rate formula</h2>
        <p>
          Cap rate, short for capitalization rate, compares a property&apos;s net operating income
          (NOI) to its value. The basic formula is:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Purchase Price or Market Value
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is usually expressed as a percentage. For example, a cap rate of 6% means the
          property&apos;s annual NOI is equal to 6% of its value, assuming you bought it all-cash.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mt-8 max-w-3xl space-y-4 text-sm text-gray-800">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 1: Understand net operating income (NOI)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Net operating income is the foundation of the cap rate formula. NOI is your annual rental
          income and other recurring income minus annual operating expenses, before any mortgage
          payments or income taxes.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Included in NOI:</span> rent, parking fees, laundry
            income, storage income, minus property taxes, insurance, maintenance, landlord-paid
            utilities, property management, HOA dues, and an allowance for vacancy and repairs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Not included in NOI:</span> mortgage payments, loan
            interest, income taxes, and one-time capital expenses like a new roof.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, if a property collects $30,000 in annual rent and has $10,000 in operating
          expenses, its NOI is $20,000.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 2: Decide which price to use in the formula
        </h2>
        <p>
          The denominator in the cap rate formula is either the property&apos;s purchase price (if
          you are analyzing a potential acquisition) or its current market value (if you already own
          it). Using price lets you see how much income you get for each dollar you pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          For beginners, it is usually easiest to start with the asking price from the listing when
          screening deals. Later, you can adjust to your actual offer price or an appraised value.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 3: Plug the numbers into the cap rate formula
        </h2>
        <p>
          Once you have NOI and price, the math is straightforward. Suppose:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>NOI = $18,000 per year</li>
          <li>Purchase price = $300,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = $18,000 ÷ $300,000 = 0.06, or 6%
        </p>
        <p>
          A 6% cap rate means that, before financing, the property&apos;s income equals 6% of the
          money you would pay to buy it. You can repeat this process for multiple properties to see
          which ones offer higher or lower income yields.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 4: Compare cap rates across properties
        </h2>
        <p>
          The real power of the cap rate formula is in comparison. On its own, a 6% cap rate does
          not tell you whether a deal is good or bad. But when you compare 6% to other properties in
          the same area, patterns start to emerge.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Property A: 5% cap rate in a prime neighborhood.</li>
          <li>Property B: 7% cap rate in a working-class area.</li>
          <li>Property C: 9% cap rate in a weaker rental market.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each property offers a different blend of income and risk. Using the same formula across
          multiple deals helps you see where you may be taking on extra risk in exchange for higher
          yield, or paying a premium for safety and appreciation potential.

          How beginners can avoid common cap rate mistakes

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Underestimating expenses:</span> If you underestimate
            taxes, maintenance, or vacancy, you will overstate NOI and show a cap rate that is too
            high.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Ignoring upcoming repairs:</span> Big one-time costs
            like roofs or HVAC replacements are not in NOI but still affect your returns. Plan for
            capital expenditures separately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Comparing apples to oranges:</span> Comparing a small
            single-family home to a large apartment building on cap rate alone can be misleading.
            Always compare similar properties in similar locations.

          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Relying only on cap rate:</span> Cap rate does not
            include financing, tax benefits, or appreciation. Combine it with cash-on-cash return
            and long-term ROI for a complete picture.

          Frequently asked questions about the cap rate formula
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Does cap rate include my mortgage payment?
        </h3>
        <p>
          No. The cap rate formula uses NOI, which is calculated before mortgage payments. Cap rate
          assumes an all-cash purchase and is meant to compare properties on a financing-neutral
          basis. To see how your loan affects returns, use cash-on-cash return or ROI.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          What is a good cap rate for beginners?
        </h3>
        <p>
          There is no universal good cap rate, but many beginners aim for properties in the
          mid-range of their local market—often around 5%–8% depending on the city—rather than the
          very lowest or highest cap rates. This helps balance income and risk while you learn.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Can I use cap rate for flips or short-term projects?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cap rate is most useful for buy-and-hold rental properties. For flips or short-term
          projects, focus more on purchase price, rehab budget, after-repair value (ARV), and total
          project ROI instead of cap rate.
