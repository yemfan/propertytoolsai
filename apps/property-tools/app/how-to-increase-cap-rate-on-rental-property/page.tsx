        Cap rate is driven by one core ingredient: net operating income (NOI) relative to property
        value. If you can increase NOI without overspending or damaging the asset, you can increase
        cap rate and, in many cases, significantly boost the property&apos;s value. This guide
        focuses on practical, sustainable ways to do exactly that.

          Start with the cap rate and NOI formulas
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cap rate is defined as net operating income divided by purchase price or value:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = NOI ÷ Property Value
        </p>
        <p>
          Net operating income is your rental and other income minus operating expenses (taxes,
          insurance, maintenance, landlord-paid utilities, management, HOA fees, and reserves),
          before mortgage payments. To increase cap rate, you focus on increasing NOI or buying at a
          lower effective value—or both.

          Strategy 1: Raise rents to market responsibly
        </h2>
        <p>
          One of the most direct ways to increase NOI is to bring under-market rents closer to
          market levels. Many long-term owners do not keep rents up to date, leaving room for
          improvement for new investors.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Research comparable rents for similar properties in your area.</li>
          <li>Plan gradual increases at lease renewal to avoid shocking good tenants.</li>
          <li>Improve unit finishes and common areas to justify higher rents.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Even modest rent increases can meaningfully raise NOI. Use the{" "}

          Strategy 2: Add new income streams
        </h2>
        <p>
          Beyond base rent, many properties can support additional income sources with minimal extra
          cost:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Reserved or covered parking fees.</li>
          <li>Pet rent or pet fees (while remaining fair and pet-friendly).</li>
          <li>On-site laundry with coin or app-based payments.</li>
          <li>Storage units, bike rooms, or lockers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because most of this revenue has low incremental expenses, it can flow directly to NOI,
          making it a powerful way to increase cap rate. The{" "}

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Strategy 3: Reduce controllable operating expenses
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cutting costs for their own sake can backfire if it leads to deferred maintenance or
          unhappy tenants. But many properties carry bloated or inefficient expenses that can be
          trimmed without sacrificing quality.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Shop insurance and service contracts regularly.</li>
          <li>Invest in energy-efficient lighting and water fixtures.</li>
          <li>Audit vendor invoices for duplicate or unnecessary services.</li>
          <li>Use smart thermostats or sub-metering where appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because cap rate is based on NOI, every dollar you permanently remove from expenses
          increases NOI and, at a given market cap rate, increases property value as well.
        </p>

          Strategy 4: Execute value-add improvements
        </h2>
        <p>
          Value-add strategies involve investing capital into upgrades that allow you to charge
          higher rents or attract better tenants. Examples include renovating kitchens and baths,
          improving curb appeal, enhancing amenities, or reconfiguring units.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to spend $1 in capital to create more than $1 of value via higher NOI. At a
          6% market cap rate, every additional $1 of stable NOI can translate to roughly $16–$17 of
          value. Well-planned value-add projects can therefore increase both cap rate and equity.

          Strategy 5: Buy at a better price or improve leasing
        </h2>
        <p>
          Another lever is the denominator in the cap rate formula: value. Buying below market value
          instantly raises your effective cap rate, because you are paying less for the same NOI.
          Additionally, tightening leasing practices can reduce vacancy and bad debt, lifting NOI.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Negotiate aggressively on price when utilities, taxes, or rents are mismanaged.</li>
          <li>Improve tenant screening and renewals to keep good tenants longer.</li>
          <li>Market vacancies proactively to reduce downtime between tenants.</li>

          Frequently asked questions about increasing cap rate
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Should I always try to maximize cap rate?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not necessarily. Maximizing income at the expense of property condition or tenant
          satisfaction can hurt long-term value and stability. Aim for sustainable improvements in
          NOI that support your target tenant profile and market positioning.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Can refinancing my loan change the cap rate?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cap rate is a property-level metric based on NOI and value, not on your financing. A
          refinance can change your cash flow and ROI, but the property&apos;s cap rate is driven by
          its income and what the market is willing to pay for that income.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          How fast can I realistically increase cap rate?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Many improvements happen over one to three years as leases turn over, renovations are
          completed, and expense changes take effect. Modeling different timelines in tools like the{" "}
