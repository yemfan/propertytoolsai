          This closing cost estimator aggregates common buyer fees such as loan
          origination charges, title insurance, appraisal and inspection fees, and other
          lender or title company costs. It also expresses the total as a percentage of
          the property&apos;s purchase price.

          Use this calculator to budget for cash due at closing and to compare quotes
          from different lenders or title providers. Investors and repeat buyers can
          quickly plug in local fee structures to forecast total transaction costs across
          multiple properties.

            charges.
            They often add up to 2–5% of the purchase price depending on your location and loan
