/**
 * Autonomy gating for AI employees.
 *
 * Reads permissions.autonomy from the employee record and routes the proposed
 * work accordingly:
 *
 *   autonomous       → execute inside executeRun; returns "executed"
 *   act_with_approval → create a to-do TASK for the owner + escalateRun + notify;
 *                       returns "escalated". No external action is taken — the
 *                       owner reads the task and acts manually. (We deliberately
 *                       dropped the separate Approvals inbox + approve-and-send.)
 *   suggest          → no side effects; returns "skipped"
 *
 * The caller supplies `execute(runId)` — the actual work callback. For
 * autonomous employees this is called with a fresh run id. For others it is
 * never called (the run is opened + immediately escalated/closed instead).
 *
 * Best-effort: errors inside `execute` are caught and close the run as "failed";
 * errors in the gating infrastructure itself are always rethrown (they indicate
 * a config problem, not a transient failure).
