        Cap rate is one of the most important metrics in multifamily investing. From small
        fourplexes to large apartment complexes, cap rate helps investors understand how much income
        a building produces relative to its price, compare deals across markets, and evaluate value
        creation opportunities.

          Why cap rate is especially important for multifamily
        </h2>
        <p>
          Multifamily properties are often bought and sold primarily as income streams rather than
          based on comparable sales of similar floor plans, the way single-family homes are. That
          makes cap rate—a direct link between income and value—a central part of how multifamily
          investors, appraisers, and lenders think about pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because multifamily buildings have multiple units and often professional management,
          investors can more accurately estimate net operating income (NOI), making cap rate a
          reliable, comparable metric across deals.
        </p>

          Cap rate, NOI, and scale in multifamily deals
        </h2>
        <p>
          The cap rate formula for multifamily is the same as for other income properties:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Property Value
        </p>
        <p>
          In multifamily deals, however, NOI often benefits from economies of scale. Fixed costs
          like management, maintenance, and certain utilities can be spread across more units,
          potentially improving margins compared to single-family rentals.
        </p>
        <p>
          When underwriting a multifamily deal, investors carefully project rental income for each
          unit, apply realistic vacancy and credit loss, and estimate operating expenses line by
          line to arrive at a stabilized NOI before calculating cap rate.

          How cap rate varies by property class and size
        </h2>
        <p>
          Multifamily cap rates are heavily influenced by the property&apos;s class (A, B, or C),
          age, location, and size.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Class A:</span> Newer, amenity-rich properties in
            top-tier locations typically command lower cap rates because investors expect stability
            and rent growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Class B:</span> Well-maintained but older assets in good
            areas often trade at mid-range cap rates, with both income and value-add potential.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Class C:</span> Older properties in working-class or
            transitional neighborhoods may offer higher cap rates but come with more operational and
            tenant risk.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Smaller multifamily (2–4 units) may also behave differently from institutional-size
          complexes. In some markets, small buildings trade more like single-family rentals; in
          others, they are priced strictly on income and cap rate.

          Using cap rate to compare multifamily markets
        </h2>
        <p>
          Multifamily investors often look at cap rate spreads between markets to decide where to
          deploy capital. For example, a core coastal market might have 4%–5% caps for Class A
          properties, while a growing secondary city might offer 5.5%–6.5% caps for similar assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Higher cap rates can mean more immediate income, but they may also reflect higher risk or
          slower growth. Many multifamily investors build diversified portfolios that include both
          lower-cap-rate, high-growth markets and higher-cap-rate, income-oriented markets.

          Value-add strategies and cap rate expansion/compression
        </h2>
        <p>
          In multifamily, cap rate is deeply connected to value-add strategies. If you can increase
          NOI through renovations, better management, or amenities, and cap rates in your market
          remain stable or compress, your property&apos;s value can increase significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, adding $50 per month in rent per unit across 40 units adds $24,000 of annual
          income. At a 6% cap rate, that extra NOI alone could support an additional $400,000 in
          value (because $24,000 ÷ 0.06 = $400,000).
        </p>
        <p>
          This leverage of small operational improvements into large value gains is one reason
          cap-rate-focused underwriting is so central to multifamily investing.

          Frequently asked questions about multifamily cap rates
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Are multifamily cap rates usually lower or higher than single-family rentals?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It depends on the market, but larger, professionally managed multifamily assets often
          trade at lower cap rates than scattered single-family rentals because institutions value
          scale, stability, and liquidity. However, in some markets small multifamily can show
          higher cap rates due to operational complexity.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Should I chase the highest cap rate in multifamily?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not blindly. Very high cap rates can indicate serious issues with location, tenant base,
          or physical condition. Focus on risk-adjusted returns: cap rate should be evaluated
          alongside occupancy trends, rent growth, and long-term demand for the area.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          How do lenders look at cap rate for multifamily loans?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Lenders and appraisers use cap rates to value multifamily properties via the income
          approach, then combine that with debt service coverage ratios and loan-to-value limits to
          size loans. Strong, stable NOI at a reasonable cap rate generally leads to more favorable
          financing terms.
