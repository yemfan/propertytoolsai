          Buyers can use this tool to compare conventional, FHA, and low-down-payment
          options, or to set savings goals before entering the market. Agents can embed

          impacts loan terms and affordability.

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            How much you should put down depends on your budget, loan options, and goals, but many
            buyers aim for 20% to avoid mortgage insurance while others use lower down payments to
            get into a home sooner.
            This calculator shows how different down payment percentages change your loan amount
            and monthly payment so you can choose a strategy that fits your finances. You can also

            How does my down payment affect my monthly mortgage payment?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            A larger down payment reduces your loan amount, which usually lowers your principal and
            interest payment and may remove mortgage insurance.
            A smaller down payment keeps more cash in your pocket but can increase your monthly
            costs. You can see this trade-off by adjusting the percentage here and then reviewing
            the payment breakdown in our{" "}

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Yes, many loan programs allow down payments as low as 3–5% for qualified buyers, and
            some government-backed loans require even less.
            These programs may involve mortgage insurance or slightly higher rates, which this
            calculator helps you factor into your monthly payment. You can compare those payments

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            The time it takes to save depends on your target amount and how much you can set aside

            Putting more savings into your down payment lowers your monthly housing cost but leaves
            you with less cash for emergencies, repairs, or other investments.
