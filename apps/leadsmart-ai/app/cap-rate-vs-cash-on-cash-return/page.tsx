        Cap rate and cash on cash return are two of the most practical metrics rental property
        investors use. They are closely related, but they focus on different parts of the deal.
        Knowing when to use each one will help you compare properties effectively and choose
        financing strategies that match your goals.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What is cap rate?</h2>
        <p>
          Cap rate (capitalization rate) measures a property&apos;s net operating income (NOI)
          relative to its purchase price or current value. It assumes an all-cash purchase and
          ignores financing.
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Purchase Price or Value
        </p>
        <p>
          Investors use cap rate to compare similar properties, understand local pricing, and
          quickly decide whether a deal deserves deeper analysis. It tells you about the property
          itself, not your specific loan or down payment.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What is cash on cash return?</h2>
        <p>
          Cash on cash return focuses on your actual invested cash. It compares annual pre-tax cash
          flow to the total cash you put into the deal, including down payment, closing costs, and
          initial repairs.
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cash on Cash Return = Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow ÷ Total Cash Invested
        </p>
        <p>
          Annual pre-tax cash flow is the money that hits your pocket each year after all operating
          expenses and debt service (mortgage payments), but before income taxes. This metric
          highlights how efficiently your invested dollars are generating cash in the near term.

          Example: cap rate and cash on cash return on the same property
        </h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a rental property with a purchase price of $300,000 and net operating income of
          $21,000. The cap rate is:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = $21,000 ÷ $300,000 = 7%
        </p>
        <p>
          Now consider an investor who buys this property with a 25% down payment and financing:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Down payment: 25% of $300,000 = $75,000</li>
          <li>Closing costs and initial repairs: $10,000</li>
          <li>Total cash invested: $85,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Suppose the annual debt service (principal and interest) is $15,000. The annual pre-tax
          cash flow would be:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Annual Cash Flow = NOI $21,000 – Debt Service $15,000 = $6,000
        </p>
        <p>
          Cash on cash return is then:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cash on Cash = $6,000 ÷ $85,000 ≈ 7.1%
        </p>
        <p>
          In this example, cap rate and cash on cash return are similar. But small changes in loan
          terms, closing costs, or cash flow can cause cash on cash to diverge significantly from
          cap rate, even when the property&apos;s NOI and price stay the same.

          In practice, most investors use both metrics together. Each shines at a different stage of
          your analysis.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          What is the main difference between cap rate and cash on cash return?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cap rate measures a property&apos;s income relative to its value and assumes an all-cash
          purchase. Cash on cash return measures how much pre-tax cash flow you earn relative to the
          actual cash you invest after financing, including your down payment and closing costs.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Is a higher cash on cash return always better?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not always. Very high cash on cash returns can come from aggressive leverage, risky
          markets, or deferred maintenance. You should balance cash on cash with cap rate, long-term
          ROI, risk, and your own comfort with leverage.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Can a property have a good cap rate but poor cash on cash return?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. If financing costs are high, or if you invest a large amount of cash relative to the
          cash flow produced, cash on cash return can be weak even when the property&apos;s cap rate
          looks solid. That&apos;s why you should never rely on a single metric.
