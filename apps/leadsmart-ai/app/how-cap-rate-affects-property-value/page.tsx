        Cap rate is more than just a return metric. It is also one of the most important drivers of
        property value in income-producing real estate. When you understand how cap rate and net
        operating income (NOI) interact, you can see why small operational improvements or market
        shifts can create big changes in value.

          The income approach: value based on cap rate and NOI
        </h2>
        <p>
          For rental properties, many investors and appraisers use the income approach to value. It
          rearranges the cap rate formula to solve for value instead of return:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Value = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Market Cap Rate
        </p>
        <p>
          In this formula, NOI comes from the property&apos;s income and expenses, while the market
          cap rate reflects how investors in that market price similar properties. A lower market
          cap rate (investors accept lower returns) implies a higher value for the same NOI. A
          higher market cap rate implies a lower value.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Example: how a small change in cap rate moves value
        </h2>
        <p>
          Consider a property that produces $50,000 in NOI per year. If the market cap rate for
          similar assets is 6%, the indicated value using the income approach is:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Value = $50,000 ÷ 0.06 ≈ $833,333
        </p>
        <p>
          If market conditions improve and investors are now willing to accept a 5.5% cap rate for
          the same NOI, the value becomes:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Value = $50,000 ÷ 0.055 ≈ $909,091
        </p>
        <p>
          That is a value increase of more than $75,000 just from a 0.5% change in the market cap
          rate. The property&apos;s NOI did not change at all; only investor expectations and market
          pricing moved.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Example: adding value by increasing NOI at the same cap rate
        </h2>
        <p>
          Now imagine the same market where 6% is still the typical cap rate, but you improve the
          property&apos;s operations. Through better management, slight rent increases, and tighter
          control of expenses, you raise NOI from $50,000 to $55,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a 6% cap rate, the value with the higher NOI is:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Value = $55,000 ÷ 0.06 ≈ $916,667
        </p>
        <p>
          That is an increase of more than $83,000 in value from an extra $5,000 of annual NOI. In
          other words, each additional $1 in stable NOI created roughly $16.67 in value at a 6% cap
          rate. This leverage effect is why many investors focus heavily on improving NOI.

          How market conditions change cap rates and values
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cap rates do not stay fixed forever. They expand and compress over time based on interest
          rates, investor sentiment, supply and demand, and perceived risk. In hot markets,
          investors may accept lower cap rates, bidding up prices for the same income. In weaker
          markets, cap rates can rise as investors demand more return for taking on risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, two investors might own similar properties with the same NOI but very
          different values depending on when they bought and what the prevailing market cap rates
          were at the time.

          Using cap rate and NOI together to create value

        <p>
          As an investor, you cannot control the market cap rate, but you can control which markets
          you invest in and how you operate your properties. Combining both levers—market selection
          and NOI growth—can create powerful value creation over time.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          How does cap rate impact what I should pay for a property?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you know a property&apos;s stabilized NOI and the typical cap rate for similar
          properties in the area, you can estimate a fair value by dividing NOI by that market cap
          rate. Paying much more than this implied value can reduce your returns unless you have a
          clear plan to increase NOI or expect cap rate compression.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Is a lower cap rate always better?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A lower cap rate means a higher value for the same NOI, which is good if you already own
          the property. But if you are buying, a very low cap rate may mean you are paying a premium
          price for the income. Balance cap rate, NOI growth potential, and your investment
          strategy.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Can I control the cap rate on my property?
        </h3>
        <p>
          You cannot single-handedly set market cap rates, but you can influence the effective cap
          rate your property achieves by increasing NOI. You can also choose to invest in markets
          and property types where you believe cap rates will remain stable or compress over time.
