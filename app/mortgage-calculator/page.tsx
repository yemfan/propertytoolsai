          How to use this mortgage calculator
        </h2>
        <p>
          This mortgage calculator helps home buyers estimate their monthly principal and
          interest payment based on the purchase price, down payment, interest rate, and
          loan term. Adjust the inputs to compare different scenarios before you talk to
          a lender or make an offer on a property.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use this tool to quickly understand how changes in rate or loan term affect
          affordability, total interest paid, and long-term cost of home ownership. It is
          ideal for first-time buyers, investors, and agents who need clear payment
          estimates during showings or consultations.

            <p className="mt-1">
              Most mortgage calculators use a standard loan amortization formula that spreads your
              balance, interest rate, and term over fixed monthly payments.
              Each payment includes both principal and interest, with interest paid first and
              principal paid down over time. For a detailed payoff schedule, try our{" "}

              To get useful results, you should know your target home price, expected down payment,
              approximate interest rate, and preferred loan term in years.
              Many buyers test different down payment amounts to see how the loan size and monthly

              Yes, comparing 15-year and 30-year terms in a mortgage calculator shows you the
