        When you apply for a loan on a rental property, the bank is not just looking at your credit
        score. For income-producing real estate, lenders focus heavily on the property itself—its
        net operating income (NOI) and the cap rate the market assigns to that income. Understanding
        how banks use cap rate to value property helps you prepare stronger deals and avoid
        surprises during underwriting.

          The income approach: value from NOI and cap rate
        </h2>
        <p>
          For rental properties, banks and appraisers often use the income approach to estimate
          value. This method rearranges the cap rate formula:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Value = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Market Cap Rate
        </p>
        <p>
          The appraiser will estimate stabilized NOI based on current and market rents, typical
          vacancy, and realistic operating expenses. They then divide that NOI by a cap rate that
          reflects recent sales and risk in the local market to arrive at an income-based value.
        </p>
      </section>

          Example: how a bank might value a rental using cap rate
        </h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a small apartment building with an appraiser-estimated NOI of $90,000 per year.
          Recent sales of similar buildings in the same area suggest a market cap rate of 6%.
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Income-based value = $90,000 ÷ 0.06 = $1,500,000
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the contract purchase price is $1,600,000, the lender may anchor on the
          appraiser&apos;s income-based value of $1,500,000 when deciding how much to lend. If the
          bank&apos;s maximum loan-to-value (LTV) is 75%, they might size the loan around:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Maximum loan ≈ 75% × $1,500,000 = $1,125,000
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, cap rate and NOI together influence both the appraised value and the maximum
          loan amount the bank will consider.

          Cap rate, LTV, and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Banks do not look at cap rate in isolation. They combine it with loan-to-value and debt
          service coverage ratio tests to make sure the property&apos;s income can comfortably
          support the proposed loan.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">LTV (Loan-to-Value):</span> the loan amount divided by
            the appraised value (often limited to 70%–80% for investment property).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio):</span> NOI divided
            by annual debt service (principal and interest payments). Many lenders require DSCR of
            1.20–1.30 or higher.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A higher cap rate (for the same NOI) means a lower value, which can reduce the maximum
          loan at a given LTV. But if a higher cap rate also reflects stronger cash flow relative to
          the loan payments, DSCR may be more favorable, which the bank likes.

          Why conservative NOI and cap rate assumptions matter to lenders
        </h2>
        <p>
          Banks are in the business of getting repaid, so they tend to err on the side of caution.
          That means:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Using market rents instead of overly optimistic pro forma rents.</li>
          <li>Applying realistic vacancy and expense ratios based on local data.</li>
          <li>Choosing cap rates that reflect risk and recent sales, not just the best comps.</li>
        </ul>

          How cap rate impacts refinance and exit strategies
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cap rate is not only relevant at purchase. It also plays a big role when you refinance or
          sell a property. If you increase NOI through better management or value-add improvements,
          and cap rates in your market stay the same or compress, your property&apos;s value (and
          equity) can grow significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, increasing NOI from $90,000 to $105,000 at a 6% cap rate raises income-based
          value from $1,500,000 to $1,750,000. Banks take this into account when sizing refinance
          loans, and buyers consider it when making offers, because higher NOI at the same cap rate
          justifies a higher price.

          Frequently asked questions about how banks use cap rate
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Do banks always use the same cap rate as the market?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not exactly. Appraisers typically choose cap rates based on recent comparable sales, but
          they may adjust for factors like property condition, tenant quality, and lease terms.
          Banks then rely on that appraised cap rate and NOI as part of their underwriting.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Can I influence the cap rate the bank uses?
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can&apos;t dictate the cap rate, but you can influence how the property is perceived.
          Strong financial records, quality tenants, long-term leases, and well-documented
          improvements can justify a lower cap rate (higher value) if they reduce perceived risk.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          What happens if the bank&apos;s value is lower than my purchase price?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If the income-based appraisal comes in below your contract price, the bank may base its
          loan amount on the lower value, reducing how much they&apos;re willing to lend. You may
          need to bring more cash to closing, renegotiate the price, or reconsider the deal.
