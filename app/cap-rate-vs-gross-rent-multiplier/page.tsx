        Cap rate and gross rent multiplier (GRM) are both ways to relate a property&apos;s price to
        its income. Cap rate looks at net operating income (NOI), while GRM looks only at gross
        rent. Understanding how they differ—and how to use them together—will help you screen deals
        faster and avoid overpaying.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What is cap rate?</h2>
        <p>
          Cap rate compares a property&apos;s net operating income to its value. It tells you the
          income yield a property generates each year as a percentage of its price, assuming an
          all-cash purchase.
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Purchase Price or Value
        </p>
        <p>
          Because cap rate includes operating expenses, it is more precise than GRM and better for
          detailed comparison of properties once you have accurate income and expense data.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What is gross rent multiplier (GRM)?</h2>
        <p>
          Gross rent multiplier is a simpler metric that relates a property&apos;s price to its
          gross annual rent, without considering expenses:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          GRM = Purchase Price ÷ Gross Annual Rent
        </p>
        <p>
          A lower GRM means you are paying fewer dollars for each dollar of gross rent, which can be
          attractive—but because GRM ignores expenses, two properties with the same GRM can have
          very different bottom lines.

          Example: comparing cap rate and GRM on the same property
        </h2>
        <p>
          Suppose a duplex costs $360,000 and brings in $3,000 per month in rent ($36,000 per year).
          The gross rent multiplier is:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          GRM = $360,000 ÷ $36,000 = 10
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, estimate operating expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, management,
          etc.) at $14,000 per year. Net operating income is:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          NOI = $36,000 – $14,000 = $22,000
        </p>
        <p>
          The cap rate is then:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = $22,000 ÷ $360,000 ≈ 6.1%
        </p>
        <p>
          GRM told you that the property costs 10 times its annual rent. Cap rate told you that, net
          of expenses, it yields just over 6% on an all-cash basis. Both are useful, but cap rate
          gives a fuller picture once expenses are known.

          How cap rate and GRM relate to each other
        </h2>
        <p>
          Although cap rate and GRM use different inputs, they are both reflections of price relative
          to income. In fact, if you know a property&apos;s operating expense ratio, you can roughly
          convert between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if expenses are 40% of gross rent, then NOI is 60% of gross rent. In that
          case:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate ≈ (NOI ÷ Price) = (0.60 × Gross Rent) ÷ Price = 0.60 ÷ GRM
        </p>
        <p>
          So if GRM is 10 and expenses are around 40% of income, you might expect a cap rate near
          6%. This kind of back-of-the-envelope math can help you sanity-check deals quickly.

          Frequently asked questions about cap rate vs GRM
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Is there a “good” GRM like there is a “good” cap rate?
        </h3>
        <p>
          GRM, like cap rate, is market-specific. A GRM that looks high or low in one city may be
          perfectly normal in another. Always compare GRM values to similar properties in the same
          area and combine GRM with expense estimates before making decisions.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Should I ever rely on GRM alone to buy a property?
        </h3>
        <p>
          It&apos;s risky to rely on GRM alone because it ignores expenses, which can vary widely
          between properties. GRM is best used as an early filter, followed by cap rate and full
          cash-flow analysis with realistic expense assumptions.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Which metric do appraisers and lenders care about more?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Appraisers and lenders typically focus more on cap rates and NOI, because they reflect the
          property&apos;s true income after expenses. However, GRM can still appear in some market
          analyses, especially for smaller residential income properties.

          Cap rate and gross rent multiplier are not enemies—they are tools designed for different
          stages of analysis. Use GRM for fast scans when you only know rents, and cap rate once you
          have a handle on expenses and want a more accurate view of income and value.
