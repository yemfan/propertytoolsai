        Cap rate is one of the fastest ways to analyze a rental property, but only if you follow a
        clear process. Instead of guessing whether a deal looks good, you can use cap rate to
        quantify income relative to price and compare properties side by side. This guide walks you
        through that process step by step.

          Step 1: Gather the key inputs for cap rate
        </h2>
        <p>
          To analyze a property using cap rate, you need three main ingredients: potential rental
          income, realistic operating expenses, and a purchase price or value. Without these, any
          cap rate calculation is just a guess.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 2: Estimate net operating income (NOI)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Net operating income is the property&apos;s annual income after operating expenses, before
          mortgage payments and income taxes. It is the backbone of the cap rate formula.
        </p>
        <p>
          A simple framework:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Start with potential rent: monthly rent × 12.</li>
          <li>Subtract a vacancy allowance (for example, 5%–8%).</li>
          <li>Add other recurring income (parking, storage, etc.).</li>
          <li>Subtract realistic operating expenses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The result is your estimated NOI. For quick analysis, you can plug these numbers into the{" "}

          to avoid doing the math by hand.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 3: Calculate cap rate for the property
        </h2>
        <p>
          Once you have NOI and a price, calculating cap rate is straightforward:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Purchase Price or Value
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if NOI is $20,000 and the property costs $300,000, cap rate is about 6.67%
          ($20,000 ÷ $300,000). This tells you that, before financing, the property&apos;s income
          yield is 6.67% of the price.
        </p>

      <section className="mt-8 max-w-3xl space-y-4 text-sm text-gray-800">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 4: Compare cap rate to your targets and market data
        </h2>
        <p>
          A cap rate number only becomes meaningful when you compare it to something: your target
          range and the typical range for similar properties in the same area.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Ask local brokers and property managers what cap rates are common for similar assets.</li>
          <li>Look at recent sales comps and compute NOI ÷ sale price.</li>
          <li>Define your own minimum acceptable cap rate based on your goals and risk tolerance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your calculated cap rate is much lower than local norms, the property may be
          overpriced—or the income may be under-optimized. If it is much higher, you may have found
          an opportunity or a property with hidden risks that require deeper due diligence.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 5: Use cap rate as a filter, not the final decision
        </h2>
        <p>
          Cap rate is excellent for quickly filtering and ranking potential deals, but it should not
          be the only decision-maker. After a property passes your cap rate filter, move on to
          deeper analysis.

          basic income requirements.

          Example: analyzing a rental property using cap rate
        </h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a small rental listed at $280,000. Market rent is $2,100 per month, with tenants
          paying utilities.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Gross annual rent: $2,100 × 12 = $25,200.</li>
          <li>Vacancy allowance (5%): $1,260.</li>
          <li>Effective income: $25,200 – $1,260 = $23,940.</li>
          <li>
            Estimated expenses: $5,000 taxes, $1,200 insurance, $1,800 maintenance, $1,917
            management (8% of effective income), total ≈ $9,917.
          </li>
          <li>NOI ≈ $23,940 – $9,917 = $14,023.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Cap rate ≈ $14,023 ÷ $280,000 ≈ 5.0%. You can now compare this 5% cap rate to your target
          range and to other properties you are analyzing.

          Frequently asked questions about analyzing properties with cap rate
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          How many properties should I analyze before buying?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Many investors analyze dozens of properties on paper—often 20 to 50 or more—before making
          an offer. Cap rate makes this practical by giving you a quick way to eliminate the clear
          &quot;no&quot; deals early.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Should I use current rent or market rent in my analysis?
        </h3>
        <p>
          For initial screening, it is helpful to look at both. Use current rent to see how the
          property performs today and market rent to understand upside potential and what cap rate
          might be achievable after you implement your plan.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          How does cap rate fit with my &quot;buy box&quot;?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Your buy box is your set of criteria for acceptable deals—location, price range, property
          type, and minimum returns. Many investors set a minimum cap rate (for example, &quot;I
          only look at properties at 6% cap or higher in this market&quot;) as part of that buy box.
