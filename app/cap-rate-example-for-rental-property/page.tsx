        Seeing a full cap rate example on a real-world rental makes the concept much easier to
        understand. In this guide, we&apos;ll walk through the numbers step by step on a sample
        single-family rental, then discuss how to interpret the result and what it means for your
        investment decision.
      </p>

          Step 1: Start with the property details
        </h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a 3-bedroom rental house in a stable suburban neighborhood. The seller is asking
          $320,000. Similar homes in the area rent for about $2,300 per month, and the property
          taxes, insurance, and other expenses are typical for the market.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Asking price: $320,000</li>
          <li>Expected monthly rent: $2,300</li>
          <li>Tenants pay utilities; landlord pays taxes, insurance, and lawn care.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 2: Estimate annual rental income and vacancy
        </h2>
        <p>
          First, convert monthly rent into annual rent, then account for vacancy and credit loss.
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Gross annual rent = $2,300 × 12 = $27,600
        </p>
        <p>
          Assume a 5% vacancy and credit loss rate to reflect turnover and occasional missed
          payments:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Vacancy allowance = 5% of $27,600 = $1,380
          <br />
          Effective rental income = $27,600 – $1,380 = $26,220
        </p>
        <p>
          If the property has any additional income (for example, $50/month for a parking space),
          add that to the effective income figure.
        </p>

      <section className="mt-8 max-w-3xl space-y-4 text-sm text-gray-800">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 3: Estimate annual operating expenses
        </h2>
        <p>
          Next, estimate the property&apos;s annual operating expenses. These are the costs of
          running the property, not including your mortgage payment. For this example:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Property taxes: $4,800 per year</li>
          <li>Landlord insurance: $1,400 per year</li>
          <li>Maintenance &amp; repairs (budget): $1,800 per year</li>
          <li>Lawn care and snow removal: $900 per year</li>
          <li>Property management (8% of effective income): 0.08 × $26,220 ≈ $2,098</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Total operating expenses ≈ $4,800 + $1,400 + $1,800 + $900 + $2,098
          <br />
          Total operating expenses ≈ $10,998
        </p>
        <p>
          You can refine these numbers with quotes from vendors and managers, but this estimate is
          detailed enough for an initial cap rate calculation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mt-8 max-w-3xl space-y-4 text-sm text-gray-800">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 4: Calculate net operating income (NOI)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Net operating income is effective income minus operating expenses:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          NOI = Effective income – Operating expenses
          <br />
          NOI ≈ $26,220 – $10,998 = $15,222
        </p>
        <p>
          This $15,222 represents the property&apos;s annual income from operations before any debt
          service or income taxes. It is the key input for the cap rate formula.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mt-8 max-w-3xl space-y-4 text-sm text-gray-800">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Step 5: Compute the cap rate</h2>
        <p>
          Now divide NOI by the purchase price (or your offer price) to find the cap rate:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = NOI ÷ Price
          <br />
          Cap Rate ≈ $15,222 ÷ $320,000 ≈ 0.0476, or about 4.8%
        </p>
        <p>
          At the asking price of $320,000, this rental property has an approximate cap rate of 4.8%.
          This is the income yield you&apos;d earn if you bought the property all-cash at that
          price, before financing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mt-8 max-w-3xl space-y-4 text-sm text-gray-800">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 6: Interpret the cap rate in context
        </h2>
        <p>
          Whether 4.8% is &quot;good&quot; depends on the local market and your goals. In some
          high-demand, supply-constrained metros, a 4.8% cap rate may be normal or even attractive.
          In other markets, investors might expect 6%–8% or more for similar properties.
        </p>
        <p>When interpreting the result, ask:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>How does 4.8% compare to other recent sales in this neighborhood?</li>
          <li>Is there room to increase rents or reduce expenses to lift NOI over time?</li>
          <li>Does the property offer strong appreciation potential or strategic value?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If local comps show similar homes trading at 5.5%–6% cap rates, you might conclude this
          property is slightly overpriced at the current rent and ask price—or that your income
          assumptions are conservative and NOI could be improved.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Step 7: Test alternative scenarios with a calculator
        </h2>
        <p>
          Before you decide to walk away or move forward, test a few &quot;what if&quot; scenarios.
          For example:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>What if you negotiate the price down to $300,000?</li>
          <li>What if you raise rent to $2,450 over the first year to match nearby comps?</li>
          <li>What if you self-manage initially, reducing management expense?</li>
        </ul>

          Frequently asked questions about cap rate examples
        </h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          What if my actual expenses end up higher than estimated?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If actual expenses are higher, NOI and cap rate will be lower than your initial
          calculation. That&apos;s why it&apos;s important to use conservative estimates, stress-test
          your numbers, and talk with local professionals before buying.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Can I use this same process for multifamily properties?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. The steps are the same for duplexes, fourplexes, and larger buildings—you just sum up
          income and expenses across all units. In fact, cap rate is especially common in multifamily
          analysis.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          How many cap rate examples should I work through as a beginner?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Working through 10–20 real or hypothetical cap rate examples is a great way to build your
          intuition. Use listings from your target market, plug them into a calculator, and compare
          the results to your minimum acceptable cap rate.
