        Cap rate and return on investment (ROI) are two of the most commonly used metrics in real
        estate investing. They are related, but they are not the same thing. Understanding how they
        differ—and when to use each one—will help you make better decisions, avoid overpaying, and
        build a portfolio that matches your goals.

      <section className="max-w-3xl space-y-4 text-sm text-gray-800">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What is cap rate?</h2>
        <p>
          Cap rate, short for capitalization rate, measures a property&apos;s net operating income
          (NOI) relative to its purchase price or current market value. It answers the question:
          &quot;If I bought this property in cash today, what annual return would I earn from
          operations before financing?&quot;
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Purchase Price or Value
        </p>
        <p>
          Because cap rate ignores financing, it is a property-level metric. It tells you about the
          asset itself, not your personal investment structure. Investors use cap rates to compare
          similar properties, understand local market pricing, and estimate value using the income
          approach.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What is ROI in real estate?</h2>
        <p>
          Return on investment (ROI) measures how much profit you earn relative to the total cash
          you invest in a deal. In real estate, ROI can be calculated in several ways, but a simple
          version looks at total profit divided by total cash invested over a given period.
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          ROI = (Total Profit ÷ Total Cash Invested) × 100%
        </p>
        <p>
          Total profit can include cash flow from rents, loan paydown, appreciation, and tax
          benefits, depending on how detailed you want to be. ROI is investor-specific because it
          depends on your down payment, loan terms, holding period, and exit strategy.

          Cap rate vs ROI: key differences
        </h2>
        <p>
          While both metrics involve returns, they answer different questions and are used at
          different stages of your analysis.

        <p>
          Think of cap rate as a quick, high-level screening tool and market pricing signal. Think
          of ROI as a deeper, personalized view of how a specific deal will perform for you.

          Example: same cap rate, different ROI
        </h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a small rental property that sells for $300,000 and produces $18,000 in net
          operating income. The cap rate is:
        </p>
        <p className="font-mono text-xs bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-3">
          Cap Rate = $18,000 ÷ $300,000 = 6%
        </p>
        <p>
          Now compare two investors who buy the same property at the same price and NOI:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Investor A:</span> buys all-cash, investing $300,000 of
            their own money.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Investor B:</span> uses a 25% down payment ($75,000)
            and finances the rest with a mortgage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The property&apos;s cap rate is still 6% for both investors because NOI and value have not
          changed. But their ROIs will look very different once you factor in loan payments, closing
          costs, and how much cash they each invested. With the right financing, Investor B could
          achieve a much higher ROI than 6% due to the leverage effect, even though the cap rate is
          fixed at 6%.

          When to use cap rate vs when to use ROI
        </h2>
        <p>
          In practice, you will often use both metrics at different stages of the investment
          process.

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Use cap rate when you:</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Screen a large number of listings quickly.</li>
          <li>Compare similar properties in the same neighborhood.</li>
          <li>Evaluate whether asking prices make sense for the income being produced.</li>
          <li>Talk with brokers, appraisers, and lenders about market pricing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-4">Use ROI when you:</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Model your personal returns based on your down payment and loan terms.</li>
          <li>Compare different financing options for the same property.</li>
          <li>Plan how long to hold a property and what exit returns you expect.</li>
          <li>Compare real estate investments against other asset classes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In short, cap rate helps you decide whether a property is worth deeper analysis. ROI helps
          you decide whether that specific deal fits your portfolio and financial goals.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          What is the main difference between cap rate and ROI?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cap rate is a property-level metric that compares NOI to value and ignores financing. ROI
          is an investor-level metric that compares total profit to the cash you invest, including
          the effects of leverage, holding period, and exit strategy.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Can a low cap rate deal still have a strong ROI?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. A property in a low-cap-rate market can still produce strong ROI if you buy at a
          discount, add value through renovations or better management, or use conservative leverage
          that amplifies returns without adding too much risk.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Which metric do banks care about more?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Lenders often look at cap rates and NOI to assess the property and its ability to support
          debt. They also evaluate your personal financial strength and debt service coverage
          ratios, which are more closely related to cash flow and ability to repay the loan than to
          your long-term ROI.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">
          Should I ignore a deal if the cap rate looks low?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not automatically. A lower cap rate can reflect a safer market with strong appreciation,
          better tenant quality, or lower volatility. It may still be a good fit if it aligns with
          your goals and you are prioritizing stability and growth over immediate cash flow.
        </p>

          The best investors rarely rely on a single metric. Use cap rate to understand the
          property, and ROI to understand how the deal performs for you. Then layer in cash-on-cash
          return, debt paydown, and appreciation to see the full picture.
